###### 5nap8ack
##A simple tool for creating backups/snapshots of files or partitions. It is currently written for bash specifically,\n I'm working on getting it ported over to python soon to deal with some interoperability issues.

To download and run the script simply "git clone https://github.com/51D/5nap8ack.git && cd 5nap* && ./5nap*"
